# Project for CML1010 on the Machine Learning Lifecycle - NLP (Natural Language Processing) Project
In this project we use the movie dataset from Stanford University. 

The project consists of 4 Milestones, in which we go through the machine learning lifecycles. 
PROJECT MILESTONE 1:  Problem, Dataset,  Exploratory Data Analysis
PROJECT MILESTONE 2: Feature  Engineering, Baseline Model, and Interpretability
PROJECT MILESTONE 3:  Machine Learning Implementations
PROJECT MILESTONE 4:  Improvements in Machine Learning Life-cycle
